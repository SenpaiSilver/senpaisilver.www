                I, SenpaiSilver, the Weeb Otaku VTuber coding monkey, Senpai of all and kouhai to
                none, am a big fan of giant robots that I could not pilot during my teens.

                My content revolves around gaming, talking and gunpla/plamo (models). I also produce
                videos such as reviews and essays in French so I can share passions, disappointment
                and some deep thinking.

                I'm <GlitchedAge /> years old and my favorite color is none other than RED. I stream
                mainly in French but do not hesitate to speak to me in English. I'm also able to
                speak a bit of Japanese.
