            <p>
                I, SenpaiSilver, the Otaku VTuber coding monkey, Senpai of all and kouhai to none,
                am a big fan of giant robots that I could not pilot during my teens.
            </p>
            <p>
                My content revolves around gaming, talking and gunpla/plamo (models). I also produce
                videos such as reviews and essays in French so I can share passions, disappointment
                and some deep thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm <GlitchedAge /> years old and my favorite color is none other than RED. I stream
                mainly in French but do not hesitate to speak to me in English. I'm also able to
                speak a bit of Japanese.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>The beginning</h3>
            <p>
                The very first video that I published on YouTube dates back to the September 27
                <sup>th</sup> 2006. My very first scripted video came out in 2020.
                <br />
                The stream I consider being my very first and real one happened in January 2020 and
                at the time I did not have an avatar yet. My avatar first appeared in 2021.
            </p>
            <h3>2022</h3>
            <p>
                For 2022 I wanted to write and produce at least one video per month in French. That
                was a way for me to try to commit to a schedule and work on writing and editing
                videos in a more focus manner.
            </p>
            <h3>2023</h3>
            <p>
                During 2023 I decided to focus live streaming et got affiliated with Twitch on March
                20<sup>th</sup> 2023. During the same year I started streaming model building
                (gunpla & plamo).
            </p>
            <h3>2024</h3>
            <p>
                Starting 2024 I reworked my avatar's textures. I redid the face and eyes textures, I
                reworked the clothing and the colors.
